* Course Overview

# Computational Finance

* Computational Finance
* Financial Computing

What's the difference? There is a difference to use the two terms interchangeably. They are related for sure, but we will define them as follows.

---

# Definitions

## Financial Computing

* Financial computing is about operationalizing financial theories through software.

## Computational Finance

* Computational finance is about financial methods that require substantial computing, such as the Monte Carlo
  method.

## The Combination

* There is no clear separation between them, and this class is about both!

* Interpreted
* Dynamically typed
* High level (hardware abstracted)
* Highly productive
* De facto standard for scientific computing & data science
* General purpose (youtube, websites, etc)

---

# Introduction to Cython

![](images/cython.png)

* A creole language 
* Mostly Python syntax with C static types
* Compiled to C or C++ binary 
* Used to make extension modules for Python
* Very little overhead beyond C/C++
* Retain much of Python's ease of use

# The Monte Carlo Method

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) defines gives the following defintion:

> Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating random draws from a probability distribution.
